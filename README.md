Since Xander had to turn off hosting for CrashHelper to work on other projects and host stuff for Bundle, this is an updated version of CrashHelper! :D.

You can find the changelog [here](https://github.com/EthanDevelops/CrashHelperBot-Reborn/blob/master/CHANGLOG.md)

(All credit for the main code goes to [isXander](https://github.com/isXander), I'm just updating stuff when it needs to be updated and hosting the bot. as well as adding more features.)
